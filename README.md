# AnimatedTextSwitch
Animated Text Switch is a switch that allows you to add an animated representation of a boolean object.
It uses a combination of TextView and SeekBar to create a smoothly animated, fully customizable switch.
One touch on either the text or the seekbar will toggle the switch on or off, animate the seekbar from its current value to max if toggled on or minimum value if toggled off.
Upon toggling On/Off you can also indicate if a image and or color change will happen.  

See example for details on how to use this.
